# For challenge

## Task 1 - Lottery Ticket Generator

For this task, write a for loop which generates 6 random numbers for a lottery ticket - lottery numbers range from 1 to 49 for this task

The numbers should be stored in the tickets list (in any order)

## Task 2 - Count Backwards

Write code which asks the user to unput a number less than 100 (do not worry about verifying this - assume the number is always less than 100)

The code should then use a for loop to count backwards from 100 to the number the user entered, and stop on that number

E.g. - if the user enters 90 then the output should start at 100 and stop on 90

Each of the output numbers should be stored in the "output" list as well as printed to screen

## Task 3 - Iterating and a Set

We want to manufacture key rings with the car makes found in the people_cars dictionary

The size of each key ring will depend on the number of letters in the car make name

Use the set named car_make_lengths and add all unique car make length values to it. Then, return the following sentence

There will be {x} different sizes of key rings.
